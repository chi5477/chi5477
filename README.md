## 👋 About Me

Hey there! :wave: I’m Chi, a developer from Taiwan. My background is a bit unique—I’ve been building internal tools to support my family’s work in the publishing and book retail industry. Over time, I’ve come to enjoy writing code not just for efficiency, but as a way to clarify thinking and improve how we do things.

Lately, I’ve been exploring how to gradually open-source parts of what I’ve built—whether it’s internal systems, accounting workflows, or data tools—and I’m learning to use GitHub as a way to express who I am as a developer.

I enjoy building practical, focused solutions—mainly with VBA, Python, and Go on the backend, and Flutter on the frontend. I’m especially comfortable designing internal systems, handling logic-heavy workflows, and deploying to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) when things need to scale.

If you’re also interested in thoughtful, purpose-driven programming—especially in overlooked or everyday fields—I’d love to connect. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:issuesattack@gmail.com)!

## 📚 Book Lovers Welcome 

By the way—if you love books like I do, feel free to check out my family’s online bookstores!  
We’ve worked in publishing and book retail for years, and I’ve built many of our internal tools myself.  
📦 *Currently, we only ship within Taiwan.*
